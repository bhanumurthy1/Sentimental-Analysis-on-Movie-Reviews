Algorithms Used
Decision Tree
Random Forest
XGBoost
Neural Networks
Naive Bayes

Running Models
Open the ipynb file in the jupyter notebook / colab and run the cell 
i) We can see the models with their accuracies, precisions and f1 score
ii) Plots are drawn for Confusion matrices, RoC_Auc curves, epochs and losses of trained data, probability graph of naive bayes, frequency count for variables
iii) User prompt is provided at the end to know the sentiment the input given
